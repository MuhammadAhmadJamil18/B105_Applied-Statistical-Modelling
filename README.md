**Statistical Analysis Report: Walmart Sales Data** 
**1. Business Problem**

The prime business idea for this analysis is to identify the factors affecting Walmart's weekly 
sales. Walmart, being one of the largest retail corporations globally, requires precise and data
driven insights to optimize its sales strategies. Specifically, the company is interested in 
understanding the impact of economic indicators (such as unemployment rates and CPI) and 
special events (holidays) on weekly sales across different stores. 

**2. Key Business Questions**

1. Do holidays significantly impact Walmart's weekly sales?
   
2. How do economic indicators such as CPI and unemployment influence weekly sales?
   
3. Can we build a predictive model to estimate weekly sales based on economic factors and
holiday flags?

**Dataset Description** 
**3. Data Source** 
The dataset used for this analysis is the Walmart Sales data, which includes 6,435 observations 
and 8 variables. The variables included Store, Date, Weekly_Sales, Holiday_Flag, Temperature, 
Fuel_Price, CPI and Unemployment.
